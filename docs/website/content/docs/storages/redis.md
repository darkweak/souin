## What is Redis
{{% alert %}}
The redis client instance must connect to an external service (redis service) that you run on your own.
{{% /alert %}}

Redis is often referred to as a data structures server. What this means is that Redis provides access to mutable data structures via a set of commands, which are sent using a server-client model with TCP sockets and a simple protocol. So different processes can query and modify the same data structures in a shared way.
