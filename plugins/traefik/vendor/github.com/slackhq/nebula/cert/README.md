## `cert`

This is a library for interacting with `nebula` style certificates and authorities.

A `protobuf` definition of the certificate format is also included

### Compiling the protobuf definition

Make sure you have `protoc` installed.

To compile for `go` with the same version of protobuf specified in go.mod:

```bash
make
```
