Fiber middleware: Souin
================================

This is a distributed HTTP cache module for Fiber based on [Souin](https://github.com/darkweak/souin) cache.  

## Features

 * [RFC 7234](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7234.html) compliant HTTP Cache.
 * Sets [the `Cache-Status` HTTP Response Header](https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-cache-header.html)
 * REST API to purge the cache and list stored resources.
 * Builtin support for distributed cache.
 * Tag-based invalidation.


## Example
There is the example about the Souin initialization.
```go
import (
	cache "github.com/darkweak/souin/plugins/fiber"
	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
)

func main(){

    // ...
	httpcache := cache.NewHTTPCache(cache.DevDefaultConfiguration)
	app.Use(httpcache.Handle)
    // ...

}
```
With that your application will be able to cache the responses if possible and returns at least the `Cache-Status` HTTP header with the different directives mentionned in the RFC specification.  
You have to pass a Fiber `Configuration` structure into the `NewHTTPCache` method (you can use the `DefaultConfiguration` variable to have a built-in production ready configuration).  
See the full detailled configuration names [here](https://github.com/darkweak/souin#optional-configuration).
